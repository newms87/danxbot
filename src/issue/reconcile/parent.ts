/**
 * Pure helper for the parent-status derivation rule. Phase 2 of the
 * Event-Driven Worker epic (DX-215 / DX-217).
 *
 * Single responsibility: given a parent issue's children, decide what
 * the parent's status should be. The function is fully pure — no fs, no
 * db, no logger — so it can be exercised with hand-built fixtures
 * without any setup.
 *
 * Lives under `src/issue/reconcile/` because it is reconcile step 3a's
 * decision function. The poller's `recomputeParentStatuses` (a Phase-5
 * audit pass) calls this same helper for drift detection; the source of
 * truth is here.
 *
 * Priority rules (first match wins):
 *
 *  1. Any child `Blocked` → parent `Blocked`.
 *  2. Any child `In Progress` → parent `In Progress`.
 *  3. Any child `ToDo` → parent `ToDo`.
 *  4. All non-cancelled children `Review` → parent `Review`.
 *  5. All non-cancelled children `Done` → parent `Done`.
 *  6. All children `Cancelled` (no exclusion) → parent `Cancelled`.
 *
 * `Needs Approval` was retired in DX-231 (schema_version 6). The
 * orthogonal `requires_human` field replaces the parking status —
 * children carrying it do NOT propagate to the parent (only the dispatch
 * filter consults the field; epic-level rollup is purely status-based).
 *
 * Anything that doesn't fit (e.g. mix of `Review` + `Done` with no
 * `Cancelled`) returns `null` — the caller leaves the parent's current
 * status untouched. Better than forcing a guess.
 *
 * Cancelled children are excluded from rules 5 + 6 (they don't block a
 * Done / Review derivation). Rule 7 fires only when EVERY child is
 * Cancelled — a single non-Cancelled child shifts the answer.
 *
 * The `rule` string is consumed by reconcile step 5 as the `note` on
 * the appended `worker:auto-derive` `status_change` history entry
 * (DX-147), so the dashboard can correlate parent flips back to the
 * priority rule that fired without re-running the derivation.

/**
 * Apply a `deriveParentStatus` decision to an Issue. Single source of
 * truth for the THREE entangled mutations a parent-derive flip
 * produces:
 *
 *  1. Append `worker:auto-derive` `status_change` to `history[]` with
 *     the priority-rule string as `note` (DX-147 AC #1).
 *  2. If the new status is `Blocked` AND the issue has no self-block
 *     record yet, stamp one whose `reason` carries the derive rule.
 *  3. If the new status is non-Blocked AND a self-block record exists,
 *     clear it. Maintains the schema invariant
 *     `status === "Blocked" ⟺ blocked !== null`.
 *
 * Both `reconcileIssue` step 3a (the chokepoint) and the legacy
 * `recomputeParentStatuses` audit pass call this helper, so a future
 * refinement to the `worker:auto-derive` shape lands in one place
 * instead of drifting between the two writers.
 *
 * Returns the updated Issue. Pure — does not write to disk; the caller
 * owns the persistence step.
